# Il gioco delle sedie

Do you remember the game you played at theater? onee walks towards th eempty chair and the others try to capture the empty chair before. Create a 2d framework for it and then an API to implement various different ways in which the player are supposed to contrast the player seeking the empty chair.

The skeleton of the chronological deal should be smt like this:

1. Develop a window
2. Develop smt on the window
3. Develop an OOP framework with the players on the chair
4. Develop the API

It would be cool to work with gnuplot on cpp, but otherwise also python and octave are good alternatives. Maybe python better than octave, because it is much more versatile. Another option more is julia. Maybe julia would be the easiest and cooler to learn.

Okay, some julia books and resources obtained, it seems a very fast language. If it will not be too difficult to script some basic stuff I can start to use it to simply write some random graphic stuff and see then. In the meanwhile I installed Juno, the extension for VScode. The next step will be to actually start to use Julia.

Update: I obtained the book 'think like a computer scientist' for Julia (and various books about statistics and similars that now are to me still not particularly useful). I found besides the [official tutorial for plotting in Julia](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/install/). I think this two resources are the ones I really need. I think I should first read a bit randomly the plotting tutorial, and then eventually smt from the TlaCS (Think like a Computer Scientist) book. 

At this point I would avoid to develop a gif, but I would go for an animated object on a window.

update: I would create two separate folder, in one I try to develop the project in cpp, in the other one in julia.
Let use see which one inspires me the most.
